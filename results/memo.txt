In 3D GPE,
* A spherical pinning site cannot hold a vortex.
 - Couldn't create static state with a vortex pinned onto a spherical pinning site.
   Therefore, I could only get an excited state with the vortex pinned onto the spherical pinning site.
 - Vortex current (kinetic) energy + Vortex nonlinear energy > Energy saving by pinning ?
 - Can we even pin a vortex onto "spherical" pinning site in the first place?

* A cylindrical pinning site can hold a vortex.
 - Can we unpin the vortex which is pinned onto the "cylindrical" pinning site?
 - How high to pin the vortex?

* Although a vortex pinned on sphere gets unpinned eventually, it's confirmed that the vortex is energetically favored to stay pinned.
 - Reference: 3d_pinning_stability.ods
 - [Hypothesis]
   In 2D, a vortex can only shift from a pinned state to an unpinned state.
   In 3D, on the other hand, a vortex can bend its shape, so it can shift directly to vortex annihilation while remaining partially pinned.

In general,
* [SOLVED?] Imaginary-time development optimization was a bit cracky.
 - alpha value doesn't apply.
 - Result cannot be converged fully. (when changes are extreme?)
 + Confirmed the results by the previous and current methods are consistent (match in atleast 8 digits).

Planning,
* Reproduce Magnus/Proximity/Soundwave unpinnings in 3D
 - Needs adjustment for more detailed configuration: Shape, strength, number, density of pinning sites

* Reproduce glitch-like simulation.
 - A. Melatos et al. already did a calculation using HO+triangular potential.
   We will then investigate with other trap forms.
 - They proposed angular momentum conservation to reproduce the glitch behavior.
